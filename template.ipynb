    "The large growth from 2010-2020 suggests the growing trend of game development. This is largely due to game development becoming more accessible to the average person, with the release of game engines (Unity, Unreal Engine) and a growing library of assets.\n",

    "The distribution shows a singular peak at 2020, revealing that games were released at an all time in 2020. This can be explained as a consequence of COVID-19, as people became more active on the Internet during this time.\n",

    "The number of games in 2025 is misleading because the dataset is updated to March 2025. This means that there are still many games to be released throughout the year. With the continuing trend of games becoming easier to develop, we can expect that the number of games being released will increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I conducted an analysis on the distribution of the types of criticism found in 10% of all controversial Steam games.  The bar chart revealed a unimodal, right-skewed distribution. Using the median, a criticism type is typically mentioned 3292 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that 'stability' is the most common criticism in reviews. This suggests that players often go to review because they experience freezes, crashes, or bugs within the game. 'Content' is the next most common criticism, suggesting that the game lacks updates, is boring, or repetitive.\n",

Through this correlation, we can observe that these genres are likely less complex to create. \n",
